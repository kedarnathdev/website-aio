    <h1>Introduction to Spring Web MVC Framework</h1>
    <p>The Spring Web model-view-controller (MVC) framework is designed around a DispatcherServlet that dispatches requests to handlers, with configurable handler mappings, view resolution, locale and theme resolution as well as support for uploading files...</p>

    <h2>Key Design Principle: "Open for extension, closed for modification"</h2>
    <p>A key design principle in Spring Web MVC and in Spring in general is the “Open for extension, closed for modification” principle...</p>

    <h2>Features of Spring Web MVC</h2>
    <p><strong>Spring Web Flow:</strong> Spring Web Flow (SWF) aims to be the best solution for the management of web application page flow...</p>

    <p><strong>Spring's web module includes many unique web support features:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Clear separation of roles.</li>
        <li>Powerful and straightforward configuration of both framework and application classes as JavaBeans...</li>
        <li>Adaptability, non-intrusiveness, and flexibility...</li>
        <li>Reusable business code, no need for duplication...</li>
        <li>Customizable binding and validation...</li>
        <li>Customizable handler mapping and view resolution...</li>
        <li>Flexible model transfer...</li>
        <li>Customizable locale and theme resolution...</li>
        <li>A simple yet powerful JSP tag library known as the Spring tag library...</li>
        <li>A JSP form tag library, introduced in Spring 2.0...</li>
        <li>Beans whose lifecycle is scoped to the current HTTP request or HTTP Session...</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Pluggability of Other MVC Implementations</h2>
    <p>Spring MVC also offers pluggability of other MVC implementations...</p>
